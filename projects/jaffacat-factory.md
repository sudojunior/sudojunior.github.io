Made by a team of 6 (4 programmers, 1 artist and 1 designer) with a very T-shaped and frantic development cycle over a weekend, with 127 commits over two days. I became an artist with help from some fellow team members and just had some fun with Photoshop. *Since this was a 'game jam', all techniques and practices we had learned were abandoned to get this done.*
