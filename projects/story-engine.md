On one saturday (20th November), I had the bizzare idea to create a narrative engine as a basis to help my team develop their own narrative for Unreal Engine; not only built it, but also wrote the initial documentation - proper weighted branches were added the next day.

This 'code jam' is an initative of my own to keep up my programming skills (and possibly learn new aspects along the way). So far, I've achieved about one a month, with all of my findings being published to GitHub (some under MIT, others under GPL - depending on how I intend to take it further).
