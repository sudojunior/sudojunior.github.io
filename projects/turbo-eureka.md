Turbo Eureka was built in tandem with [channel-backup](channel-backup.md) to allow handling message interactions from the webhooks it creates, while still allowing it's predecessor to be used as a standalone utility.

- Feature complete within 4 days of development, and released on November 20th - within it's first week of development.
- The second service to be released by TinkerStorm, and the first to be integrated with an existing project.
