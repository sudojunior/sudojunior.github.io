While I am not an artist or a writer myself, this *was* built with the intention to host comic media posted to other social media platforms. However it failed to deploy and didn't get much traction.

It was built with Jekyll on the static side, and uses Bootstrap for the front-end. It remains as a proof-of-concept and as a blank slate - should someone wish to use it as a base for their own comic archive.

*It's idea is derived from an archived project of mine named 'Journey' which intended to be an open source proof-of-concept for IMDB-like media indexing. Both projects remain in a state of hiatus.*
