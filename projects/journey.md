Originally made during the summer of 2020, this project was an experiment in an attempt to push Jekyll to its limits. So far... I've done all but that - in fact, I've managed to to put more strain on Google Sheets than I have on Jekyll because of the one cell equations I write. ðŸ˜‚

Regardless, it continues to teach me the importance of a good data model and to be consistant with the rest of the site.
