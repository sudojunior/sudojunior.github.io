<p class="post-content">
Roy, a recently single New Yorker, finds himself emotionally adrift following his dumping at the hands of his ex-girlfriend, Lisa. He has no time to dwell, however, as a tsunami threatens the civility of central New York City. Fleeing to the rooftops, Roy takes it upon himself to ensure Lisa’s safety amid the natural disaster. The only thing standing in his way? New York City itself. You must help Roy navigate the rooftops of New York, and get to Lisa’s apartment before the rising waters engulf the city entirely. Will Roy find closure? Or will he be washed away, taking his words for Lisa to a watery grave.
