Paralight is a Co-Op Puzzle Adventure game where players choose between Sana or Ari, and work together to get back home. After crash landing onto a mysterious new planet, the two players must use their unique abilities cooperatively to traverse their new environment. While moving obstacles, levitating, or grappling, players will discover awe-inspiring forests covered in bioluminescence.

> - 2 designers (systems and levels)
> - 3 programmers (narrative, repo and systems)
> - 6 artists (environment, concept, character, models)
