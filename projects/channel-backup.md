Originally made for a friend, which was also used to maintain consistency for event information channels. *It had gone through 6 iterations before being fully released.* I also wrote a [blog post](https://dev.to/junior/keeping-discord-channels-up-to-date-fgn) on [dev.to](https://dev.to) upon releasing v1.1.1 to explain the process of development; how it was done, how it was designed; and what is planned for the future.

There are plans to expand the base functions of this utility, and to add more features to it. Most notably is the ability to construct plugins that can be used to add more functionality. There is a possibility to further expand this package as a service which can listen for component interactions.
