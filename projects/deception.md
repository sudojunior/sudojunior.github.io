Deception is a bot made as a prototype to manage game lobbies for community servers. It's extended goal is to provide a stepping stone to play the game of Mafia or Werwolf through interactions, and lay the foundations for others to build upon. This is an idea I originally had around 2017, which was abandoned when I needed to focus on other projects. Nevertheless, I've kept the notes I had on my previous attempt and will continue to make progress on it with a component approach instead of a full release plan.

... this was, and still is, an ambitious project - I do not know why I thought it would be a good idea. I got the card games to understand how I should distribute the roles; and then need to figure out how each role behaves; how to start the game in a coroutine; how to... how to.
