While the archived code is still quite a mess, the core structure and intentions remain as they were when it was originally created.

Created tags could be recalled using `[>{namespace}/{ref}]` as the call signature, which meant the 'get tag' command was never implented. Instead it serves as a quick reference code to add additional context.

It's younger, and much more refined sibling is [Hack n' Slash](./hack-n-slash.md) - with a much smaller scope in mind with Discord's new slash command system.
