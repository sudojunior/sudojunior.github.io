Coffee with Cryptids is a café management social simulator. With Yeti at your side as your faithful barista, decorate your café and choose your menu. Your design choices will attract different cryptids, and you'll meet some familiar faces as well as never before seen characters, learning their stories as they return.

> A game built by a team of 12 for around 4 months at University.
