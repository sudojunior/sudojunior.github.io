This aims to understand how the game operates individual jobs and skills while providing useful insights into what could be improved. You are more than welcome to contribute while you level up your skills, but I'll understand this if you decide that it wouldn't be a good use of your time. If you have any questions or ideas about this, please ask me in DMs.
